The darwin's natural selection theory states that living beings of
nowadays are descended from ancestors, and through evolution, genetic
changes led to the appearance of different kinds of living beings. Many
mutations are point mutations, modifying the DNA sequence, which may
prevent the information from being expressed, or may express it in
another way. The sequence comparison is the most common method to
identify the occurrence of point mutations, and is one of the most
discussed problems in Computational Biology. Genome Rearrangement aims
to find the minimum number of operations required to change one sequence
into another. These operations may be, for example, reversals,
transpositions, fissions and fusions. The concept of distance may be
defined for these events, for example, the reversal distance is the
minimum number of reversals required to change one sequence into
another~\cite{BafnaPevzner*1996} and the transposition distance is the
minimum number of transpositions required to change one sequence into
another~\cite{BafnaPevzner*1998}. We will deal with the cases in which
reversals and transpositions events occur separately and the cases in
which both events occur simultaneously. We have created Constraint
Programming models for sorting by reversals and sorting by reversals and
transpositions, following the research line used by Dias and
Dias~\cite{DiasDias*2009}. We will present Constraint Logic Programming
models for sorting by reversals, sorting by transpositions and sorting
by reversals and transpositions, based on Constraint Satisfaction
Problems theory and Constraint Optimization Problems theory. We made a
comparison between the Constraint Logic Programming models for sorting
by transpositions, described in Dias and Dias~\cite{DiasDias*2009}, and
with the Integer Linear Programming formulations for sorting by
reversals, sorting by transpositions and sorting by reversals and
transpositions, described in Dias and Souza~\cite{DiasSouza*2007}.
